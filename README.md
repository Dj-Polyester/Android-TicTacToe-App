Used min-max search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The edge length of the TicTacToe field can 
be changed using the `fieldEdgeLength` property of `MainActivity`. For the length of more than 3, program slows down due to time complexity. 
New approaches such as heuristics could be introduced, such as starting at the tiles closer to the middle or the opponent, not implemented due to limited time.
